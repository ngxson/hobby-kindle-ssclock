# [KUAL Extension] Screensaver Clock

Author: [ngxson](https://github.com/ngxson)

This KUAL extension allow displaying a clock on the screensaver. While this will surely **drain the battery**, it will still be useful when you don't want to bring anything else (smartphone, smartwatch,...) with you.

## Installation guide

Requirements: Jailbroken kindle and KUAL installed

1. Download this repo: https://github.com/ngxson/hobby-kindle-ssclock/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
2. Extract and copy all files to `extensions/ssclock`
3. Open KUAL > Screensaver Clock > START

## TODOs

- Add 12h (AM/PM) clock
- Add date

## Notes

- This extension has only been tested on my PW3.
